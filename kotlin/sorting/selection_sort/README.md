# Selection Sort
From Wikipedia:
> The Selection sort algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

## To Run:
```bash
kotlinc selectionSort.kt -include-runtime -d selectionSort.jar
java -jar selectionSort.jar
```
